# Description

'k8s-baids' stands for "Kubernetes BASH aids" and it's just a bunch of bash aliases for Kubernetes that grew up and became into a collection of bash functions.

You can use them in a standalone way (just copy/paste functions or aliases to your own files) or you can use it with [baids], a 32 LOC project to sort and manage bash functions and aliases.

# Installation

Just clone or link this project under '~/.baids/functions.d' and reload aliases:

```
git clone https://github.com/rcmorano/k8s-baids.git ~/.baids/functions.d/k8s-baids
baids-reload
```

# Usage

Here is the current almost complete functions list provided. Some are irrelevant/internal, so were removed from the list.
Although most are self explanatory, some of them provide a full documentation in [docs], some provide arguments check and usage, and some don't provide nothing yet... So please feel free to contribute :D!

```
k3s-install
k3s-install-docker-compose
k3s-install-systemd
k3s-uninstall
k8sb-get-dashboard-service
k8sb-install-k8s-dashboard
k8sb-uninstall-k8s-dashboard
kompose-get-latest-tag
kompose-install
kompose-set-version
kompose-uninstall
kompose-upgrade-to-latest-version
kubectl-create-admin-user
kubectl-delete-related-resource-on-namespace
kubectl-get-all-namespaces-names
kubectl-get-all-resources-summary
kubectl-get-all-resources-summary-for-ns
kubectl-get-all-running-pods
kubectl-get-all-services
kubectl-get-namespaced-resources
kubectl-get-nodes-external-ips
kubectl-get-nodes-internal-ips
kubectl-get-not-namespaced-resources
kubectl-get-user-token
skaffold-get-latest-tag
skaffold-install
skaffold-uninstall
skaffold-upgrade
```

You'll basically find two types of files/functions:

* _00-$K8S_PROVIDER_: this 00-priority files provide functions for installing, removing and managing k8s-related tools such as [k3s], [skaffold] or [kompose].
* _10-$K8S_TOOL_: this 10-priority files provide functions for interacting with a k8s cluster with tools like [kubectl], [skaffold]...

# Extending/Contributing

1. Fork project
2. Add some bash functions (in e.g. your custom 'docker run' for exposing port 80 for a determined project)
3. Execute 'baids-remap' and get shortened aliases for your functions
4. Commit your changes
5. Optionally, if you consider that your functions are generic enough to help someone out there, send me a pull request!

An easy way to contribute could be to write documentation for some of the baids. This can be done by writing [tomdoc](http://tomdoc.org/) right before the function definition and then, updating the markdown templates by executing:

```
k8sb-generate-doc
```
